Project Scope
The page will leverage data coming from NextBus for the TTC agency.  The links below are sample api calls
TTC Route List – This will bring all the available routes for “TTC”
http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicJSONFeed?command=routeList&a=ttc
TTC Route Stops – this will bring all the “TTC” stops for route “99”
http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicJSONFeed?command=routeConfig&a=ttc&r=99
TTC Stop Predication – this will bring the Next Trip for TTC at stop “8832” on route “99”
http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicJSONFeed?command=predictions&a=ttc&r=99&s=8832

NOTE: There is no “right” or “wrong” solution. The results will be reviewed by Metrolinx Dev Leads and may be used in follow-up technical discussions with you as the candidate.
